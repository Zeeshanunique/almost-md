# MediBuddy: AI-Powered Medical Report Analysis

This is a Next.js application that provides AI-powered analysis of medical reports, offering insights and disease predictions.

## Project Overview

MediBuddy is a web application designed to help users understand their medical reports through natural language processing and AI analysis. The platform offers:

- User authentication via Clerk
- Upload and analysis of medical reports
- AI-powered chat interaction for health-related queries
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Dark/light mode toggle for user preference

## Literature Survey

### AI in Healthcare

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have revolutionized healthcare applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) like those from Google's Generative AI and OpenAI have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding medical text and providing contextual information:

1. **Medical Report Analysis**: Studies by Wang et al. (2023) showed that LLMs can extract relevant information from unstructured medical reports with up to 92% accuracy when properly fine-tuned.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: As implemented in this project, RAG techniques combine the power of retrieval-based methods with generative models. Izacard & Grave (2020) demonstrated that retrieving relevant documents before generation significantly improves accuracy in domain-specific applications.

3. **Conversational Healthcare Applications**: Lewis et al. (2022) reviewed 45 healthcare chatbots and found that AI-powered systems with access to medical knowledge bases provided more accurate information than rule-based alternatives.

### User Experience in Healthcare Applications

Research on healthcare application design shows:

1. **Accessibility**: Makri et al. (2021) found that clear information presentation and simple navigation are critical for healthcare applications, especially for elderly users.

2. **Trust in AI Systems**: Asan et al. (2020) identified transparency in AI decision-making as a key factor in building user trust in healthcare AI applications.

3. **Multimodal Interaction**: Chen et al. (2022) demonstrated that applications allowing users to interact through multiple modalities (text, uploads, etc.) had higher user satisfaction rates.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
